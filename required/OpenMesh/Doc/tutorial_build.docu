\page tutorial_build_internal_apps How to create your own project inside OpenMesh

In this tutorial we will explain, how to create a new app inside the source code of
%OpenMesh and compile it with the CMake build system. We assume, that you have already
downloaded the %OpenMesh source files as well as installed the CMake build tools.

<b>If you only want to use OpenMesh from your program, please refer to the tutorial \ref tutorial_build  !</b>

There are quite few steps to follow to successfully add your own application to the build tree:

\li Go to OpenMeshRoot/src/OpenMesh/Apps and create a new directory, say "MyOwnProject"
\li Now create a new file called "CMakeLists.txt" containing the following lines:

\include CMakeLists.txt-internal

(Remember to replace "MyProjectName" with whatever you have chosen as your project's name.
Note: If you don't want to use *.hh and *.cc as your C++ source file suffices, you'll
have to change this, too, because CMake won't build your sources otherwise.

\li Create your source files as for example explained in the previous tutorial (\ref tutorial_01)
and save them in the same directory.

\li Add \code add_subdirectory (MyOwnProject) \endcode to OpenMeshRoot/src/OpenMesh/Apps/CMakeLists.txt (note: You can either
add this line right after the other projects or at the end of the file).

\li Create a directory called "build" in OpenMesh's root directory. Change to the newly created directory and call
\code cmake .. \endcode and \code make \endcode

That's all. Your project will now be built.


\page tutorial_build How to create your own project using OpenMesh and cmake

In this tutorial we will explain, how to create a new app using a pre build or
installed %OpenMesh library. We assume that you already donwloaded and installed 
OpenMesh or compiled and installed it. 

\li Create a folder in which you want to place the source code of your application.
\li Create a file called CMakeLists.txt containing the following lines:

\include CMakeLists.txt-external

\li We assume, that your source code is in build_cube.cc. You can take the code from \ref tutorial_01
\li Create a build directory 
\li Run cmake inside the build directory. The source directory is the directory with the new CMakelists.txt file.
\li If cmake can't find OpenMesh, Set the cmake variable <b>OpenMesh_DIR</b> to the installed OpenMesh directory and add <b>share/OpenMesh/cmake</b>
\li Go to the build directory and compile your application using the generated build files
